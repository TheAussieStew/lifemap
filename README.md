## What is this useful for?
As a general principle, this tool is designed to balance thinking with feeling. This is a balance between logic and intuition, deconstructing and viewing the whole, planned and spontaneous, reason and emotion, the mind and the heart.
- Shorter term planning (e.g. planning projects, movies or books I want to read, operational tasks like paying bills or taxes)
- Life planning (e.g. where do I want to be in 10 years, what do I want to achieve by the end of my life, how do I achieve my dreams?)
- Self-reflection (e.g. therapy, counselling, shadow work, work on thought patterns, journaling, diarying, self authoring, life review, work on relationships with others, self enquiry)
- Organising knowledge and wisdom (e.g. reviewing learnings on technical subjects, conducting scientific research, condensing and consolidating knowledge, sharing notes with others)
- Recurring habit formation and destruction (e.g. tracking learning a language daily, catching up with friends or acquaintances regularly, quitting smoking, walking 7000 steps a day)

## What is this less useful for?
While these use cases will probably work fine and probably a bit better than other tools, these are not a primary focus.
- Nothing?
