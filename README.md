# Project Lifemap

Lifemap is a part of a new category of software called personal life organisation.

Information is organised as part of fundamental units of information called quanta, and ways to view them differently called lenses. The goal of this software is to enable users to think in expanded and non-linear ways, in addition to existing linear ways to organise information. It is the hope of the author that many users in future will use this software to improve their lives on all levels, and eventually improve the lives of the people and societies around them.

Key focuses
- Humanist

Lifemap is designed to empower the individual to fully live out their lives. This is in contrast to much existing software which has a productivity maximisation focus.

- Visual

Lifemap attempts to utilise as many visual ways of organising information as possible. It tends to shy away from an excessive reliance on text and numbers.

- Kinesthetic

Lifemap attempts to organise information using their energetic qualities. This means that information has a kind of quality, and this can be visually seen at a glance, allowing the user to easily see the "health" of various areas.
