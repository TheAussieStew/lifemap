// I'm looking to create a TemporalEstimate timer based off the PomodoroTimer
// Instead of the flow switches at the beginning, it simply shows the length of the single audio file that it accepts
// It also shows a tag that displays the name of the audio file
// When the play button is pressed, the audio will start playing and a pomodoro will be created with the same length as the audio.
// If a file is dragged onto the temporal estimate, then that file will become the basis for the audio file
// Also suggest the exact hosting service that the file is hosted on
